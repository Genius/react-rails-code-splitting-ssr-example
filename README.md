# react-rails code splitting + server side rendering example

(more docs TK) the general idea here is that in order to code split and use SSR at the same time, we need to take advantage of webpack's multi-compiler mode, which webpacker doesn't support out of the box

### Setup
```
rails new --webpack=react --skip-turbolinks app
bundle add react-rails
bundle exec rails generate react:install
yarn add @loadable/component @loadable/server
yarn add -D @loadable/babel-plugin @loadable/webpack-plugin
```

run `./bin/webpack` at least once before running `bundle exec rails s`

### How it works

- Multi-compiler Webpack config: [config/webpack/environment.js](config/webpack/environment.js)
- Custom server renderer: [config/initializers/react.rb](config/initializers/react.rb) and [app/javascript/packs/server_rendering.js](app/javascript/packs/server_rendering.js)
